## The Game

The Legend of Ericc is a turn-based single player rogue-like game made in Java with the help of ECS in Ashley. Our team wanted to try something new so we picked up game designing and we learn on the fly, so any suggestions would be highly appreciated. You can download and play our game (or even drop us some tests!) for free.

## Log

### 20.03.19
After a brief research we ended up with this little fade in/out animation for sprites when the player moves (currently WIP, we might implement other system first and then come back to this one)

### 17.03.19
We decided to implement FOV and fog of war, this is the result (there are some animations that we need to add in later sprints),
we based our fov algorithm on raytracing

### 16.03.19
After the first sprint we ended up with some stupid mobs (rendering is done real time, the mobs can turn only after the player makes a move, there are no mobs collision yet)

### 10.03.19
For our first procedural map generation we implemented BSP algorithm, we do consider chaning it to tunelling one.
