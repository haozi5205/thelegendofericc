## The Game

The Legend of Ericc is a turn-based single player rogue-like game made in Java with the help of Ashley ECS and LibGDX. Our team wanted to try something new so we picked up game designing and we learn on the fly, so any suggestions would be highly appreciated. You can download and play our game (or even drop us some tests!) for free.

## Features
-  Turn-based (nothing happens until you move)
-  Field of view
-  Random map generation
-  Multiple monsters and skills
-  Equipment system
-  A powerful boss...
